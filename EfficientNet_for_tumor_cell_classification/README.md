Deep Learning for Blood Cell Classification
This project focuses on the automatic classification of blood cell images into eight categories using deep learning. The final solution employs EfficientNetB0 with transfer learning, Global Average Pooling, and a robust data augmentation pipeline (including CutMix). The model achieved strong generalization on unseen data, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning and well-tuned augmentations for biomedical image analysis.
