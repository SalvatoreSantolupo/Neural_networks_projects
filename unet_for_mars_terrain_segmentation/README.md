This project focuses on multi-class semantic segmentation of Martian surface images, developed as part of the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning (AN2DL) course at Politecnico di Milano.
A custom U-Net architecture was implemented and refined through the integration of Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP), Squeeze-and-Excite (SE) blocks, and Adaptive Fusion (AF) layers.
To handle class imbalance and improve generalization, the team experimented with several loss functions, data augmentation strategies, and learning rate schedulers.
